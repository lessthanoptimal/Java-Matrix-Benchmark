----- Version 0.10

2013/10/29

- Factories are not created until a the new VM is launched
  * Avoids potentially contaminating the version info which is printed.  e.g. one library loads an older version first
- Version information is printed into its own file now
- Tweaked make file to build the application by default
- Each library is fully described by a single LibraryDescription instead of spreading that information across several
  locations
- Refined small matrices to be up to 10.  Before it was only 4
- New summary plots for runtime results


----- Version 0.9

2012/03/03

- Combined stability and runtime factories in a single factory
- Added La4j library

----- Version 0.8

2011/02/19

- Can now truncate runtime data when creating plots.
- Added a tool for comparing results from a library across different results directories.
- To make it more future proof EvaluationTarget now refers to the libraries name instead of MatrixLibrary directly.
- Can now query the library itself at runtime to determine its version
- When resuming a trial it no longer overwrites the old log file and instead creates a new one.
- Reworked memory benchmark to use unix specific tools to get a more accurate estimate
- Improved runtime benchmark resume so that more of the old results are reused.
- Added summary box and whisker plot.
- Runtime now uses a CSV format for results.  More human readable and refactoring won't screw things up constantly now.
- MTJ benchmark was accidentally using non-symmetric EVD
- Checks user input to see if 'q' has been pressed and gracefully quits the benchmark.

----- Version 0.7

2010/08/08

- Updated runtime memory allocations so that they are a more accurate prediction initially.
- Libraries can configure themselves at runtime
- Changed the way input matrices are created for runtime benchmark
  * The same amount of benchmark overhead is now created for each library, making the test more fair.
  * Total memory requirements should be reduced.
- Totally dropping support for JScience since it does not provide a set(row,col) method as far as I can tell.
- multTranA test is changed to multTranB test.  transposing A was arbitrary, but it created two scenarios where
  a column major format had an advantage.  Might as well give one where a row major has an advantage.
- Fixed bug where overhead was being measured in runtime benchmark
- Made stability benchmark's accuracy criteria more rigid
- Runtime benchmark now remembers how much memory that was been successfully used in the past and allocates at least that much
  in the future.
- Added stability test for SPD inverse.

----- Version 0.6

2010/04/28

- Updated version of OjAlgo, ParallelColt, UJMP
- Added JBlas to runtime and stability benchmarks
- Turned off LU,QR, Cholesky decompositions from runtime performance test.  Not often used directly and
  the functions which use them and are used directory (solve,inv,symm inv) are already included.
- Turned off jscience by default since its weak and taking up room in the plots.
- Flagged all libraries as using native code or not
- For runtime performance plots, libraries can be filtered by using native code or not.
- Added command line tool in jar file for launching other tools
- Change the way the desired runtime of a test and the maximum allowed runtime for a test are handled to make
  processing of larger matrices easier.
- Can plot results from CSV file
- Added the ability to turn on and off sanity checks in runtime benchmark
- Logs slave command line arguments when a failure occurs.
- EJML runtime benchmark now uses LinearSolver.
- Added memory usage benchmark

----- Version 0.5

2010/02/23

- Updated version of Parallel Colt (fixed bugs discovered with this benchmark)
- Updated EJML and Commons-Math libraries
- SVD overflow no longer creates matrices that have exactly the same singular values.
  They are slightly perturbed from each other.   This was to make a more realistic test scenario.
- Proved HTML tables. Thanks Anders Peterson for the suggestions.
- Changed SVD accuracy so that an input matrix of zero can't be created
- Modified MTJ, Colt, and Parallel COlt benchmarks so that do not overwrite input matrices.
- Modified all runtime benchmark so that everything that can be predeclared is not done so inside of the timing area.
- Can plot runtime results relative to the mean, median, max result now
- Added sanity checks to runtime performance that makes sure the operations are producing meaningful results.
- Changed how Commons-math creates matrices
- Changed which matrices parallel colt uses
- Changes tested operations in colt and parallel colt uses suggestions from Piotr Wendykier 
- Added a converter for runtime results that change it into CSV format
- Added specialized inverse performance test for symmetric positive definite matrices (covariance)
- Added absolute time plots which show how long it takes to perform one operation
- Added ability to resume old results by pointing runtime benchmark at a results directory

----- Version 0.4

2010/01/22

- Can load XML based config files.
- Adjusted OjAlgo benchmark to take in account its caching of previous results
- Updated to the latest version of OjAlgo
- New random seed for each trial in a block
- First stability benchmark

----- Version 0.3

2009/11/29

- Added Colt, Parallel Colt, UJMP, and ojAlgo.
- Refactored benchmark tests into a single class for each library
- computes more metrics. Mean, stdev, median, min, max.
- Dynamically computes the memory for the slave
- Better error recover.
  * Creates an error log where it writes exceptions to instead of throwing an exception.
- Broke solve benchmark up into two tests.  One for square and the other for non-square matrices.
- Slave can exit if a library leaves a stray thread around.
- each library saves its output into its own directory
- To avoid accidental overloading, jars are now loaded at runtime.
  * All benchmarks should be run from ant for now on since IDEs will load everything.
- Detects if a slave is frozen and kills it.
  * Also prints out messages every 60 seconds so it is easy to tell if the master is frozen
- Added benchmark for eigen decomposition for symmetric matrices

----- Version 0.2

2009/11/10

- Added QR decomposition benchmark.
- Truncated partially finished runs to make nicer graphs.

----- Version 0.1

2009/10/26

- First time I bothered keeping track of changes and set the version to 0.1
- Added QR decomposition algorithms to benchmark
- Slave will now output the library's name
